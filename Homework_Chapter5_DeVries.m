% % 5.2 Indexing into a linear array in real world co-ordinates
% % Miguel collects data for an EEG experiment.  Each session of data consists of 30 trials, each lasing 5s. The EEG machine records data every 2ms. Strangely his data looks like a perfect sinusoid, with 0 mean normally distributed noise.

ntrials=30;
durtrial=5*1000;
timevec=0:2:durtrial*ntrials;
data=sin((2*pi* timevec)/(durtrial))+.1*randn(size(timevec));
plot(timevec, data, '-');
% %
% % a)  What is the mean response during all the data points that are within the first ½ second of every trial

timechunk=(length(data)-1)/ntrials;
data_means= [];
mean2=[];

for i=0:(ntrials-1)
    trialidx=i*timechunk+1;
    data_range=data(trialidx:trialidx+250);
    mean2=mean(data_range);
    
    data_means = cat(1, data_means, mean2);
end

mean_final=mean(data_means);

% % b) What is the mean response during the interval 2-2.5s of each trial?a

data_means2=[];

for i=0:(ntrials-1)
    trialidx=i*timechunk+1;
    data_range2=data(trialidx+1000:trialidx+1250);
    mean2=mean(data_range2);
    
    data_means2 = cat(1, data_means2, mean2);
end

mean_final2=mean(data_means2);

% % c) during which timepoints does the EEG response have values greater than 0.9?

dataindex=find(data > 0.9);
timevec(dataindex);


% % d) during which timepoints does the EEG response have values between 0.7 and 0.8?

dataindex2=find(data >= 0.7 & data <= 0.8);
timevec(dataindex2);

% %  5.3 Indexing into a matrix using real world co-ordinates

% % Sam Lin collects data on 70 rats. 20 of them were duds and their data were thrown away.
%
% ratID=Shuffle(1:70); ratID=sort(ratID(1:50));
% %
% % On the remaining rats he collects 10000 trials, and he calculates the % correct across each bin of 100 trials.

ratID=randperm(70); ratID=sort(ratID(1:50));
binsteps=1:100:10000;
[X, Y]=meshgrid(1:length(ratID), 1:length(binsteps));
per=Y+randi(10, size(Y))-5;
per(per>100)=100;
per(per<0)=0;

% % a) image the rats performance in a matrix with trials along the x axis and rats along the y axis using a colormap that varies between white for 100% correct and black for 0% correct (not using imagesc)
% 
cmap=colormap(gray(100));
% cmap(per==0, :)= 0;
% cmap(per==100, :)= 1; % don't need these lines
image(per); 
colormap(cmap); %% i just chose 100 for the number of trials but not sure that's a good metric to adjust your colormap by..

% % b) change the colormap so that values above 90% are white and values below 10% are black.

cmap=colormap(gray(100));
cmap(per<10, :)= 0;
cmap(per>90, :)= 1;
image(per); 
colormap(cmap);

% % c) how many rats performed above 66% correct between trials 6001-7001?

trialind=find(binsteps>=6001 & binsteps<=7001); 

per_trialind=per(trialind, :);
per66_ind=find(mean(per_trialind, 1) > 66);
numel(per66_ind) % this is a really nice way to do this

% I think you went round in a small circle?
% dunno if this is the most efficient way, but sometimes it helps me do each logical step when i'm thinking through it.
% taking it a step at a time is sensible

% % d) which rats were they?

rat66ID=ratID(per66_ind); %almost, you had the point
disp(rat66ID); 

% % e) How many trials would be needed for 40/50 rats to be performing above 80%.

per80=find(per > 80); % this turns things into a vector which is going to make finding the rat ID's really hard
trialnumidx=X(per80); 
trialnum=round(numel(trialnumidx)*.8); 
disp(trialnum); %my brain is broken and im not sure my logic is sound here. 

% think about this way of doing it ( I think Geoff did it a little differently
per80=per>80;
numover80=sum(per80,2);
minTover80=find(numover80>40);
minTover80(1);
binsteps(minTover80(1))

% % f) It turns out that for the rats with even ID numbers (2, 4, 6 10 etc.) the recording machine was on the blink for an interval between the 5678th trial and the 7533rd trial. Convert those numbers to NaN.
% %
badBins=find(binsteps>=5678 & binsteps<=7533); 
perBad=per;
perBad([badBins], find(mod(ratID,2)==0))=NaN;
imagesc(perBad')
