%% Q 4.2: 3d matrices

% a) Create a 3x3x3 matrix of zeros and set the very middle of the 3-d matrix to be a value of 1. 

mat3=zeros(3,3,3); 
mat3(2,2,2)=1; 

% b) Create a 5x5x5 matrix of zeros and set the middle 3x3x3 cube to 1.

mat5=zeros(5,5,5);
mat5(2:4,2:4,2:4)=1; 

%% Q 4.3: sub2ind and ind2sub

% a)  Suppose you have a 4x3 matrix (4 rows and 3 columns).  What is the index into the element that is in the 3rd row and 2nd column?

mat4x3=ones(4,3); 
sub2ind([4,3],3,2); % i was able to work it out but the [4,3] was kind of a guess--is it just the size of the matrix? 


% b) For the same size matrix, what is the row and column for the element with an index of 7?

matind([4,3],7); 

%% Q 4.4: logical operations

% a) Write a script so that if a variable 'x' is positive it prints the string 
% 'x is positive'


% And if x is negative the script prints the string
% 'x is negative'

x = 0;
y= 2; 
z=0;

if x < 0
    disp('x is negative')
elseif x > 0
    disp('x is positive')
else
end


% b) Write a statement that is true if the variable 'x' is either less than 2 or greater than pi.

x<2 || x>pi 

% c) Write a statement that is true if either x is greater than 2 and y is less than 4, or if z is equal to zero.

x>2 && y<4 || z==0

%% Q 4.5 While loops

%Write a script that repeatedly rolls two dice using this command:

roll = ceil(rand(1,2));


% and counts the number of rolls until [1,1] (‘snake eyes’) comes up.

count=1;
roll = ceil(rand(1,2)*6);

while sum(roll) > 2
    count = count + 1;
    roll = ceil(rand(1,2)*6);
end
disp(['Snake eyes after ',num2str(count),' rolls.']);
